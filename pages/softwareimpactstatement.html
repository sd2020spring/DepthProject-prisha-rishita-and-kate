				<p>we decided to form our group primarily based on the people, as opposed to the project. this was for the reason that we believed we’d work well together, and would create a game we’d be proud of, regardless of what its topic was. to
					decide what we were going to do, we laid out the projects we did previously, and tried to choose one of them, so at least one of us would have a little more experience with the general design of the game.
					<p wappler-command="editContent">we ended up choosing the corona game.
					</p>
					<p wappler-command="editContent">we had very high goals for ourselves during this project, and after a lot of thought, we decided to set two thresholds: the first threshold was more of a lower level game, which would be less work,
						but still something we’d be proud of. the second threshold was the original idea we wanted to go with; a high level platformer with many different components. we decided to try to accomplish the first one fully before moving
						on to the second one, for the sake of our own mental sanities.
					</p>
					<p wappler-command="editContent">we mostly focused on making the game a very lighthearted version of the current pandemic, to try to show people that there’s always something to smile about. in hindsight, though, it’s very
						possible that people can take this game to heart, especially the people greatly affected by the virus. the easiest way to mitigate this problem would be to either add a disclaimer at the beginning of the game, or not publish
						it, just to be safe.
