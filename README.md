The objective of this platformer style game is to collect as many toilet paper rolls as possible before dying of boredom or the coronavirus. 
When the game starts, the player starts off with 100% health & 100% "zest for life" and walks/ jumps around the window screen and collects toilet paper rolls. The player loses their "zest for life" over time as their boredom increases. In order to gain "zest for life", the player must collect objects such as guitars, paint brushes, eggs, and social media logos. If during the game, the player comes in contact with a sick person, their health decreases. In order to gain health, the player must collect ventilators and/or masks. The game ends if the "zest for life" bar and/or the health bar reaches 0.
