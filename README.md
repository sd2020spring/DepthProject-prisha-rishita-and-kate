# Coronavirus Themed Game
By Prisha Sadhwani, Kate Mackowiak, Rishita Sarin

The objective of this platformer style game is to collect as many toilet paper rolls as possible before dying of boredom or the coronavirus. You can also gain 5 bonus toilet papers by jumping on a sick person. 

When the game starts, the player starts off with 100 health & 100 "zest for life" and walks/ jumps around the window screen and collects toilet paper rolls. The player loses their "zest for life" over time as their boredom increases. In order to gain 5 "zest for life" points, the player must collect objects such as guitars, paint brushes, and baking supplies. If during the game, the player collides with a sick person, their health decreases by 15. In order to gain health, the player must collect ventilators and/or masks. The player reaches 100 health points if they collect a ventilator, and their health increases by 5 points if they collect a mask. The game ends if the "zest for life" bar and/or the health bar reaches 0.
